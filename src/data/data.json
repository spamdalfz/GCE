      "text": "\"It was to our incredible fortune that we connected with Jack Hollesen, owner of GrayC Electric, via a recommendation of a friend that I trust implicitly. We knew from the moment we met Jack that we had been graced with a gift. This man and his know~how, combined with his integrity, provided us with a solution for our electric vehicle charging, together with a complete garage wiring upgrade. All completed at a cost that we know was generous to us. The final outcome is unsurpassed and beautiful. We've never seen anything like the actual products he used. They were just beautiful and done with absolute focus and care. We know that GrayC Electric is focused primarily on commercial buildings, but my hope is that Jack will expand his vast knowledge and skills to assist the residential demographic that we know will flock to his integrity and wisdom (he is literally a Master Electrician by every facet conceivable). Thank YOU Jack for Being You.",
